# Summary

The AgAdapt algorithm aims to provide multimodal phenotype prediction while using the minimum number of predictor features possible.

A challenging problem in biology is incorporating large-scale data from multiple sources into machine learning models to predict organism traits. We employ deep-learning dimensionality reduction techniques for condensing large data into meaningful predictor variables. Models are then trained using a gradient-boosting regression approach.

Our AgAdapt algorithm can serve as a tool for efficient crop production and breeding.
