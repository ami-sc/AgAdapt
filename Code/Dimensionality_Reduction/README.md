  - This script performs dimensionality reduction on Genotype Data through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
  - The script has 2 modes:
    - Mode A will determine the number of principal components needed to preserve a target variance of the Genotype Data.
    - Mode B will perform a PCA using a given number of principal components.
  - Mode A can additionally generate a Scree Plot and an Explained Variance Plot if needed.
  - Mode B will output the reduced data to a given file.
